        <h1>Meet the Commander</h1>
            <p id="primer">This deck thrives on playing at instant speed, always ready to respond to your opponent’s moves with precision and timing. 
                Every spell and trigger is designed to answer threats before they can fully develop,
                slowly but surely sapping your opponents’ life totals through repeated, controlled pulses of damage. 
                The deck excels in patience and control, turning the tide of the game by carefully managing the battlefield from the shadows. 
                However, its greatest strength is also its greatest vulnerability—without Y’shtola on the field to trigger these crucial effects, 
                the deck loses its momentum and ability to maintain pressure, making protecting your commander essential to securing victory.
            </p>

            <p id="primer">The Esper colour theme is about being calm, pragmatic, and thinks long term. They are reasonable rather than emotional. Instead of reacting on instinct, 
                they see the big picture to decide the optimal path.
                Cold-hearted and robotic at worst while progressive and tactful at best, the white-blue-black colour combination showcases the power
                of autonomy and control. </p>

            
                <p id="primer">"A place for everything, and everything in its place."
